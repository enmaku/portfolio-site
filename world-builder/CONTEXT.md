# World Builder

Desktop app for procedural fantasy **worlds**: plausible **landmasses**, **settlements** and **trade networks** driven by logistics, and **histories** that produce **factions** and **rivalries** with traceable causes.

Epic: [#293](https://github.com/enmaku/portfolio-site/issues/293). Research index: [`research/README.md`](./research/README.md) (Worldbuilding Insights playlist; [Dwarf Fortress terrain notes](./research/dwarf-fortress-terrain-notes.md)).

## Language

### World Builder

Working title for the desktop app in this repo (`world-builder/`). Distinct from portfolio **projects** (Game Timer, Movie Vote, …).

_Avoid_: “Worldbuilder” as a generic verb when naming the product; “map generator” alone (maps are an output, not the whole system).

### World

One generated playable setting: **landmass**, **climate**, **resource** layout, **cultures**, **settlements**, **trade networks**, **political** structure, and **history log**, tied to a **seed**.

_Avoid_: “Setting” alone in export/schema keys; “planet” unless generation is explicitly planetary.

### Landmass

Continental-scale geography output: elevation, coastlines, hydrology, **biomes**, and derived movement-cost fields—not political borders. Produced by the **landmass pipeline** (scalar **fields** → derived geography → **logistics pass** → **rejection sampling**).

_Avoid_: “Map” alone when meaning the full **world** document; “terrain texture” for the political/economic layer; painting biomes or borders before underlying **fields** exist.

### Physical terrain baseline

Minimum **landmass** before **logistics pass**, **rejection sampling**, or **history log**: all continental **scalar fields** plus **biome** labels derived from field overlap (**fields before labels**). Erosion, river graph, lakes, **named regions**, and resource nodes are later **derived geography**—not required for the baseline.

_Avoid_: Treating biome tint alone as “done” **landmass** when **scalar fields** were skipped or painted; calling the baseline the full **landmass pipeline**.

### Closed island rim

**Landmass** layout where map edges are forced to ocean so generated land reads as one surrounded continent (or archipelago) rather than an arbitrary rectangle clip. Distinct from cylindrical wrap or land bleeding off the viewport edge.

_Avoid_: “Island generator” as the whole product; conflating with **maritime reach** economics.

### Landmass pipeline

Ordered generation stages for one **landmass**: **scalar fields**, derived geography (biomes, hydrology), **logistics pass**, **rejection sampling**, then handoff to **culture engine**, **settlement** placement, and **history log**. Physical terrain completes before history simulation begins—same high-level split as Dwarf Fortress world creation (see research notes).

_Avoid_: “Worldgen” as a single opaque step; skipping **validation checks** and accepting incoherent geography.

### Scalar field

Continuous raster over the **landmass** grid—elevation, temperature, rainfall, drainage, salinity—generated before biome labels. Biomes and **resource rasters** **arise** from field overlap (**fields before labels**), not from painting forest/desert tiles first.

_Avoid_: “Biome map” as the first artifact; discrete biome picker without sub-fields.

### Rain shadow

The two-sided way terrain reshapes rainfall along the **prevailing wind**: windward flanks facing the wind gain rainfall as air is forced to rise, while leeward slopes behind high terrain dry into belts on the far side of ranges. Part of rainfall **scalar field** generation—not a separate **biome** label painted by hand.

_Avoid_: “Desert biome slider”; rain shadow as leeward-only drying with no windward enhancement; rain shadow as a post-hoc biome override without elevation input.

### Prevailing wind

Direction moisture crosses the **landmass**; one bearing per generation (often derived from **geography seed**, overridable in UI). Carries ocean moisture inland—soaking windward coasts and drying deep interiors—then drives the bidirectional **rain shadow** (wet windward flanks, dry leeward belts) and biases where wind-blown snow accumulates and melts on highland caps. A stylized transport pass, not a permanent **climate** simulation.

_Avoid_: “Wind biome”; treating wind as a cosmetic bearing with no effect on rainfall or snow; conflating with storm **natural threat** events.

### Salinity

**Scalar field** for salt content of water/soil exposure: maximum in ocean and **closed island rim**, tapering inland with distance from sea. Informs coastal and wetland **biome** boundaries—not a **strategic resource** node layer by itself.

_Avoid_: “Salt layer” when meaning trade **strategic resource** placement; uniform inland salinity without coastal gradient.

### Fields before labels

Design rule: generate basic geographic **fields**, derive classifications (biomes, marshes, arable bands), then run hydrology and **logistics pass**—never place political or settlement labels on a blank aesthetic map. Opposite of map-first border drawing (playlist #05).

_Avoid_: “Start with coastlines and kingdom names”; **culture** or **faction** borders before **landmass** stages finish.

### Named region

Contiguous geographic area with a generated label; may span several **biomes** if connected (e.g. one forest name across taiga and jungle). **Exchange** and **connectivity** often attach at **named region** scale, not only per tile.

_Avoid_: “Kingdom” when meaning a pre-political geographic cluster; one biome equals one culture region.

### Continental biomes (physical terrain baseline)

**Biome** labels derived from **scalar field** overlap at **physical terrain baseline**—fourteen types in v1 of this layer:

Ocean, Coast, Grassland, Savanna, Temperate forest, Tropical rainforest, Taiga, Tundra, Desert, Scrubland, Swamp, Hills, Mountain, Glacier.

Freshwater-lake and river-corridor labels wait for hydrology **derived geography**. No Dwarf Fortress fantasy axes (good/evil, savagery).

_Avoid_: Painting these labels before **fields before labels** completes; treating the list as **culture** names.

### Simulation hydrology

Pre-refine drainage physics from the **landmass pipeline** through settled extract: flow direction, accumulation, and the settled centerline before optional **meander refine**. Input to refine and paint—not the authoritative definition of **traversable water** once the final map is drawn.

_Avoid_: "River network" or "river network mask" alone when meaning settled centerline vs final display; treating settled connectivity as final when **meander refine** bridged segments on the map; using simulation-only graphs for **validation checks** that claim to measure traversable rivers.

### Presentation hydrology

Map-facing hydrology after optional refine and paint: display river centerline, painted corridor width, and river-adjacent display biome labels. Consumed by the renderer and display biome refresh.

_Avoid_: "River network mask" when meaning simulation centerline; conflating with **simulation hydrology** when the question is what the player sees on the map.

### Traversable water

Water a **movement cost** or **trade route** graph treats as passable by boat or downstream haul—the same water the final map shows as river, lake, or navigable coast. **Canonical rule:** if the cell reads as water on the rendered **landmass** output, it is traversable; generation heuristics (including **meander refine**) must not draw connected rivers that the simulation then ignores.

_Avoid_: "Navigable" metrics computed from a separate centerline graph while the map shows different connectivity; **simulation hydrology** alone as the traversability source when presentation paint disagrees; cosmetic bridges that fail the blue-pixel test.

### Logistics pass

World Builder–specific **landmass pipeline** stage after physical terrain: **movement cost**, **haul-shed**, **maritime reach**, **arable envelope**, **strategic resource** placement, and **population ceiling** inputs—bulk haul economics the playlist defines and Dwarf Fortress does not model at macro scale.

_Avoid_: “Economy sim” for the whole **world**; conflating with **history log** or **conflict engine** ticks.

### Rejection sampling

Regenerate the candidate **landmass** when **validation checks** fail (missing haul corridors, **population ceiling** violation, impossible capital site)—same belt-and-braces pattern as Dwarf Fortress world rejection, but grounded in logistics constraints rather than biome quotas alone.

_Avoid_: “Retry button” without logged reject reasons; accepting broken worlds for speed.

### Geography seed

Deterministic input to **landmass pipeline** stages through **logistics pass** and **validation checks**. Same **geography seed** + params → same terrain fields and derived graph; independent of **history seed**.

_Avoid_: “World seed” alone when history events must also be reproducible; conflating with **seed** when both are meant.

### History seed

Deterministic input to **history log** simulation after **landmass** and initial **settlement** / **faction** placement. Same **geography seed** with different **history seed** → same map, different **rivalry** and borders.

_Avoid_: Single **seed** in export when authors need to share geography-only or replay history variants.

### Culture engine

Causality-driven framework for generating **cultures**: **environmental pressures** and **five forces** run **WAAC cycles** that emit **culture layers**—not aesthetic-first trait picking.

_Avoid_: “Lore generator”; “culture tables” that pick dress and gods without pressure inputs.

### WAAC cycle

**Want** → **obstacle** → **action** → **consequence**. One loop of problem-solving; the **consequence** becomes the next **obstacle** or **want**. Same pattern under **culture engine** and **conflict engine**.

_Avoid_: “WAC” / “WOAC” in product copy (playlist variants); one-off **events** without a recorded consequence chain.

### Five forces

Active pressures that run **WAAC cycles** and interact: **environment**, **power**, **belief**, **exchange**, **legacy**. One force’s **consequence** can become another’s **obstacle**.

_Avoid_: Treating these as wiki section headers only; “pillars of culture” without cycle semantics.

### Environment (force)

Geography, **climate**, **resources**, and natural threats—the physical pressures that start most forward-generated **cultures**.

_Avoid_: “Nature” as a vibe word; conflating with the **environmental pressure** stack (finer-grained inputs).

### Power (force)

Authority, hierarchy, control—who holds scarce assets and how rule is maintained or challenged.

_Avoid_: “Politics” alone when the **force** sense is meant; “government type” labels before **power centers** exist.

### Belief (force)

Religion, philosophy, values, worldview—especially explanations that **legitimize power** or cope with uncontrollable threats.

_Avoid_: “Religion” alone when **belief** includes secular ideology; random pantheons without threat inputs.

### Exchange (force)

Trade, conflict, migration, cultural contact—isolation vs synthesis with outsiders.

_Avoid_: “Trade” alone when diplomacy and raid economics matter; “foreign policy” without **connectivity** context.

### Legacy (force)

Historical events, trauma, and collective memory that still constrain present **WAAC cycles**.

_Avoid_: “Backstory” as unstructured prose; “ancient history” with no present-tense pressure.

### Environmental pressure stack

Bottom-up inputs that shape **culture** before institutions: **landscape** (movement cost, visibility, connectivity), **climate** (predictability, survival stress, resource cycling), **resource profile** (scarcity and abundance), and **natural threats** (predictability, frequency, defensibility).

_Avoid_: “Biome picker” aesthetics; single-axis desert vs forest without sub-pressures.

### Six culture layers

Outputs of running the **culture engine**—generated, not invented top-down:

1. **Survival strategy and material culture** — food, water, shelter, tools.
2. **Social organization** — families, roles, coordination structures.
3. **Value systems** — moral priorities, shame and honor.
4. **Worldview and temporal culture** — time, death, divine, causality.
5. **Expression and symbolic culture** — art, architecture, visible symbols.
6. **Cultural expressions** — language, food culture, rituals, communication style.

_Avoid_: “Culture sheet” checklists; shuffling layer order as if independent.

### Causality-driven design

Building from pressures and cycles so traits connect; opposite of aesthetic-first design (“warrior culture that values honor” then fill blanks).

_Avoid_: “Realistic” without traceable cause; museum-exhibit **cultures** (detailed but disconnected).

### Reverse-engineering culture

Working backward from an observed trait (ritual, taboo, institution) to the **environmental pressure** or **force** that plausibly caused it—validates generated **cultures** and GM-facing explanations.

_Avoid_: Post-hoc one-line justifications with no chain; “because it's cool.”

### Conflict engine

Under any political surface (feudal, republic, tribal, …): **power centers** with wants, blockers, and actions—the machine that produces ongoing **rivalry**. Built from **WAAC cycles**, not throne furniture.

_Avoid_: “Factions” lists with static alignments; “everyone hates the evil king” without **obstacles**.

### Political skeleton

Shared structure beneath political labels: **power centers** + **conflict engine**. Thrones and senates are furniture on the skeleton.

_Avoid_: “Government type” as the first design step; copying Earth nation names.

### Power center

A group or institution that wants to keep or gain something and faces **obstacles**—nobles, merchant houses, chiefs, priesthoods, councils, etc.

_Avoid_: “Faction” when the economic want is unspecified; single ruler as the only **power center**.

### Political middle layer

Between apex **great houses** (or crown) and local populations: **vassals**, march lords, castellans—where empires actually fray. Conditional **loyalty** lives here.

_Avoid_: Flat king → five houses hierarchies; **loyalty** as a boolean switch.

### Conditional loyalty

Owed allegiance with history and terms—not permanent unless the **supply chain** or coercion still holds. **Vassals** defect when the math or story breaks.

_Avoid_: “Betrayal” without prior obligation logic; eternal fealty flags.

### Great house

Apex **power center** competing for influence, territory, or succession—sits above the **political middle layer**.

_Avoid_: “Kingdom” when the house is the actor; family name without economic base.

### Vassal

**Middle-layer** holder of delegated authority (land, fort, toll)—**loyalty** tied to protection, profit, or habit.

_Avoid_: “Lord” generically for every noble; vassal without a liege relationship.

### Supply-chain feudalism

Pre-industrial rule as logistics: **baronies** and **castles** exist because grain, salt, or goods had to move before they rotted—not because someone drew a border.

_Avoid_: “Feudalism” as costume; **realm** borders without **haul** logic.

### Grain circle

Feedback loop: garrison needs food → road must be safe → grain must move → farmers need protection → garrison needs food. Break one link and the node dies.

_Avoid_: Castles “for flavor”; wars without supply stakes.

### Ox paradox

Haul decay: draft animals consume roughly a fixed fraction of bulk cargo per distance unit; long land routes can deliver nothing but fed beasts. Caps effective **haul-shed** size.

_Avoid_: Infinite overland caravans; “500 miles” without cargo math.

### Haul-shed

Region where delivery still pays after **ox paradox** (and road **movement cost**). Primary limit on land **trade** and garrison feeding.

_Avoid_: “Radius” in miles only; use **travel time** at human scale where possible.

### Three-day rule

Rule of thumb: beyond ~three days' **travel time** by cart, bulk food **haul** often fails economically—not tradition, arithmetic.

_Avoid_: Stating distances in miles/km alone for RPG prep; “two weeks north” without consistency.

### Travel time

Primary spatial measure for play and simulation—“three days on horseback” beats raw distance.

_Avoid_: “Hexes” in domain language unless the product explicitly uses a hex grid.

### Movement cost

Energy or time to cross terrain (slope, swamp, road quality); high cost → isolation, local self-sufficiency; low cost → **exchange** and blended **cultures**.

_Avoid_: “Difficult terrain” without graph weights; uniform plains with no connectivity story.

### Maritime reach

Where sea **haul cost** (~order-of-magnitude cheaper than land) extends feeding and **trade** beyond **haul-shed**—enables **drain cities** and empire-scale flows.

_Avoid_: Ports that are decorative; continents fed entirely by ox cart from one capital.

### Drain city

**Settlement** that concentrates flow (often port or river hub)—“parasite” in the sense of importing surplus from a wide **arable envelope** or **maritime reach**, not local subsistence.

_Avoid_: “Capital” with arbitrary population; metropolis in a food desert.

### Population ceiling

Maximum plausible urban or regional population implied by **arable envelope**, **haul-shed**, and **maritime reach**—an output of geography, not a slider first.

_Avoid_: “100k city” by aesthetic; capitals larger than their hinterland can feed.

### Arable envelope

Land that can sustainably feed a **settlement** or **drain city** given era-appropriate yields and **haul**—typically many times the built area for pre-industrial density.

_Avoid_: Farmland drawn only as map texture; farm percentage ignored (~80–95% rural in pre-industrial models).

### Strategic resource

Geographically sparse necessity (salt for preservation, metals, timber above treeline gaps)—controls **trade routes**, **rivalry**, and who taxes whom.

_Avoid_: “Rare ore” with no logistics effect; salt as flavor text.

### Chokepoint

Pass, strait, ford, or toll segment where **movement cost** forces traffic—natural fort and **trade** leverage.

_Avoid_: “Border” lines without funnel geography; castles off the corridor.

### Trade route

Graph edge or corridor where moved goods still pay after **haul decay**—rivers, roads, sea lanes, **salt roads**—often explains **settlements** and **political middle layer** placement.

_Avoid_: “Trade route” as a line on art without volume or commodity; every road equal.

### Settlement

A persisted population node (hamlet to **drain city**) whose tier and role should be justified by **arable envelope**, **chokepoint**, **strategic resource**, or **trade route**—not random dots.

_Avoid_: “City” / “town” labels without simulation backing; one capital per kingdom by default.

### Faction

Simulated **power center** or aligned group with territory claims, economic wants, and **rivalry** edges—emerges from **history log**, not only from culture dress.

_Avoid_: “Race = faction”; static good/evil teams.

### Rivalry

Directed political tension between **factions** with stored causes (border, succession, trade denial, old war)—for GM-readable hooks.

_Avoid_: “They hate each other”; rivalry without **legacy** or resource **obstacle**.

### History log

Ordered **epochs** and events (founding, conquest, famine, treaty) that feed **legacy** and reshape borders.

_Avoid_: “Timeline” as flavor-only; events that don’t touch **power centers**.

### Epoch

Discrete simulation tick for **history log**—generational or seasonal abstraction, not necessarily year-by-year.

_Avoid_: “Year 1042” precision without source events; real-time simulation in v1 copy.

### Seed

Deterministic input to generation; same **seed** + params → same **world**. Prefer explicit **geography seed** and **history seed** in the **world document** when stages are separable.

_Avoid_: “Random” without reproducibility; sharing worlds without **seed** export; one opaque seed when debugging requires knowing which stage diverged.

### World document

Serializable snapshot: **geography seed**, **history seed**, stage parameters, geography **fields**, **settlements**, **factions**, **trade routes**, **history log**, derived **culture** summaries.

_Avoid_: “Save file” in UI copy when the artifact is author-facing; PNG-only export as the whole **world**.

## Relationships

- **Landmass pipeline → fields before labels**: **scalar fields** (elevation, rainfall, temperature, drainage, salinity) overlap into **biomes** and **resource rasters**; hydrology is derived (erosion, river graph)—not painted first (Dwarf Fortress pattern; see research notes).
- **Landmass pipeline → logistics pass**: after physical terrain, **ox paradox**, **arable envelope**, **maritime reach**, and **strategic resource** nodes apply—World Builder’s layer on top of DF-style geography.
- **Rejection sampling → validation checks**: failed **population ceiling**, haul corridor, or node presence → regenerate candidate **landmass**; reject reasons inform tuning.
- **Geography seed / history seed → world document**: same map with different **history log** when only **history seed** changes.
- **Named region → culture engine**: **exchange** and **connectivity** pressures often differ by contiguous region cluster, not single-tile **biome**.
- **Landmass → environmental pressure stack**: elevation, hydrology, and **climate** produce movement cost, visibility, connectivity, predictability, survival stress, and **resource profile** inputs.
- **Environmental pressure stack → culture engine**: pressures run **WAAC cycles** that fill **six culture layers** per people; **exchange** modulates isolation vs synthesis.
- **Culture engine → settlement simulation**: **survival strategy** and **resource profile** bias where people cluster (water, arable land, defensible **chokepoints**, junctions).
- **Ox paradox + movement cost → haul-shed**: caps land **trade**; explains **three-day rule** and spacing of **baronies** along **grain circle** routes.
- **Maritime reach → drain city**: sea **haul cost** enables large **population ceiling** off-site; **strategic resource** ports become **power centers**.
- **Settlement + haul → trade route**: routes are viable edges on the movement graph; **chokepoints** attract toll **vassals** and forts.
- **Trade route + strategic resource → conflict engine**: scarcity creates **obstacles** between **power centers**; **exchange** force drives smuggling and alliance.
- **Supply-chain feudalism → political middle layer**: **vassals** hold nodes on **grain circle** and **trade route** graphs; **conditional loyalty** when logistics shift.
- **Five forces → conflict engine**: same **WAAC** machinery as **culture engine**; **belief** **legitimizes** **power**; **legacy** stores grudges as **rivalry**.
- **History log → legacy → rivalry**: wars and treaties rewrite borders and **faction** wants; present politics read from the log, not freehand borders.
- **Reverse-engineering culture ↔ export**: GM-facing tooltips trace rituals and borders to pressures for table use.

## Example dialogue

- “This **drain city** isn’t impossible—the **maritime reach** from the delta feeds it; the **arable envelope** on the map is three days upstream.”
- “The pass **chokepoint** explains the **vassal** fort; if we add a lowland road, **conditional loyalty** breaks because the **grain circle** bypasses them.”
- “Run one **WAAC cycle** for the desert **environment** force before naming gods—wellkeepers are a **consequence**, not a aesthetic pick.”
- “**Rivalry** here is trade denial on **salt**, not ‘evil neighbors’—check the **strategic resource** layer.”
- “Same **geography seed**, new **history seed**—the delta’s still there; only the **faction** borders moved.”
- “**Rejection sampling** dropped that map: capital over **population ceiling** with no **maritime reach**.”

## Landmass constraints (simulation inputs)

Geography is not decorative: **landmass pipeline** stages must emit fields the **culture engine**, **settlement** placement, and **conflict engine** consume. Logistics-first worldbuilding (playlist #05, #15–#18, #13); field-first terrain and rejection pattern informed by [Dwarf Fortress terrain research](./research/dwarf-fortress-terrain-notes.md).

### Pipeline stages (canonical order)

1. **Scalar fields** — elevation, temperature, rainfall (with rain shadow), drainage, salinity.
2. **Derived geography** — **biomes**, erosion, river graph, lakes, coast navigability, mineral and **strategic resource** nodes.
3. **Logistics pass** — **movement cost**, visibility, connectivity, **arable envelope**, **maritime reach**, natural threat zones.
4. **Rejection sampling** — **validation checks**; regenerate on failure.
5. **Downstream handoff** — **culture engine**, **settlement** nodes (choke, junction, surplus, refinery, **drain city**), **trade routes**, then **history log** (**epoch** ticks).

Physical **landmass** completes before **history seed** simulation runs.

### Required geographic outputs

- **Movement cost** — slope, barriers, road potential; drives isolation vs **exchange** and **haul-shed** extent.
- **Visibility / cover** — open vs enclosed terrain; drives defensive culture (mobility vs ambush vs **chokepoint** holding).
- **Connectivity** — valleys vs plains vs sealed basins; isolated **cultures** vs harbor **exchange**.
- **Hydrology** — rivers (haul edges, flood predictability), lakes, coast; floodplains tie to **climate** predictability and bureaucracy vs neighbor-trust.
- **Climate bands** — predictability, **survival stress**, **resource cycling** (storable vs perishable vs nomadic follow-the-grass).
- **Resource rasters** — arable soil, timber, metals, **strategic resource** nodes (especially preservation-critical goods like **salt**).
- **Natural threat zones** — predictable vs random hazards (defensible with engineering vs **belief**-driven responses).
- **Maritime navigability** — where **maritime reach** overrides **ox paradox** limits.

### Locale interest (RPG-facing)

Interesting play locations tend to sit where pressures collide:

- **Chokepoints** — passes, straits, fords (forts, toll **vassals**, ambush culture).
- **Haul junctions** — where **grain circle** routes meet rivers or roads (inn, market, **barony** seat).
- **Resource mismatch** — abundance beside scarcity (fertile river delta everyone wants; timber above treeline forcing ingenuity).
- **Drain-city candidates** — coast or river hub inside wide **arable envelope** or long **maritime reach**.
- **Border friction** — narrow **haul-shed** overlap between **factions** (trade denial, **rivalry**).
- **Legacy anchors** — defensible positions whose logistics later failed (ruined fort, ghost **settlement** on a bypassed road).

### Validation checks (world feels “read,” not invented)

Used by **rejection sampling**; same role as Dwarf Fortress biome and feature quotas, but logistics-grounded:

- No **population ceiling** violation: urban nodes fit their **arable envelope** and **haul** mode.
- No impossible capitals: apex **settlements** sit on sea, river, or rich hinterland—not isolated peaks without **maritime reach**.
- **Trade routes** follow low **movement cost** paths; long bulk hauls respect **ox paradox** unless **maritime reach** applies.
- Viable haul corridors exist between arable zones and **drain city** candidates where params expect them.
- **Political middle layer** aligns with **supply-chain feudalism** nodes, not random castles.
- **Strategic resource** scarcity produces explainable **conflict engine** wants (salt wars, timber monopolies).
- Resource-mismatch zones present where params expect interesting friction (fertile delta beside scarcity, rain-shadow dry belt).

## Flagged ambiguities

- **Simulation vs presentation hydrology (#358, #365):** glossary now treats **traversable water** as map-truth (blue pixel). Existing docs and code still split simulation graph from presentation paint for navigability metrics—reconcile in implementation.
- **WAAC** spelling vs playlist “WAC” / “WOAC”—canonical here is **WAAC cycle** (four explicit steps).
- **Fantasy races** vs **culture**: playlist #14 argues species should diverge in cognition/biology; v1 **culture engine** may assume human-norm peoples unless a separate species layer is added later.
- **Magic / industrial exceptions**: **ox paradox** and **population ceiling** assume pre-industrial logistics; teleportation, flying mounts, or preservation magic need explicit overrides or they break **supply-chain feudalism**.
- **Map-first vs story-first**: playlist #05 warns against pretty maps before need; World Builder generates geography-first for simulation, but export should still answer “why is this port valuable?” like a journey-driven story map.
- **Dwarf Fortress depth vs v1 scope**: DF history is full agent simulation; v1 **history log** may use lighter **epoch** ticks with stored **rivalry** causes—same “simulation log, not authored timeline” pattern, not necessarily DF agent count.
- **DF research vs implementation**: terrain notes are conceptual inspiration for **fields before labels**, hydrology-as-derived-graph, and rejection *pattern*—not a mandate to match DF algorithms (e.g. midpoint-displacement elevation), biomes, fantasy layers (good/evil, savagery), or rejection UX (hundreds of silent retries). **`world-builder/core`** ships in JavaScript with JSDoc (portfolio repo convention), not a separate TypeScript toolchain.
